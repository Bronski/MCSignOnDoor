MINECRAFT Sign On Door
Version %VERSION%
by Tustin2121
----------------------
This program tells players attempting to connect to a minecraft server on this 
machine a message (defaulting to a 'server is off' message). This program 
cannot and is not meant to run while the minecraft server itself is running; 
it is meant to give a message to players as to why the server is not running.

Usage: java -jar MCSignOnDoor.jar [switches]
Command line switches:
	-? --help		Displays this message and quits
	-p --port		Sets the port the messenger runs on (default: %PORT%)
	-i --address	Sets the ip address the messenger runs on (default: null)
	-m --message	Sets the message to send to connecting players 
					(250 char max) (default: %AWAYMSG%)
	   --motd    	Sets the server list message of the day (Defaults to 
					truncated message setting)
	   --ignoreping	Sets McSod to ignore incoming pings; Server appears offline
	   --players	Sets the player ratio given in pings (in form "1/10")*
	-l --log		Supplies a log file to write to 
					(default: does not use log file)
	-s --silent		Does not print output to the screen

Notes:
* Some command lines treat the bang (!) as a special command character.
  If you would like to use a bang in your server message, be sure to escape
  it with a backslash (\).
* Messages can also contain color codes by using an ampersand (&) followed by
  a hexadecimal value (0-9 a-f). See the MC wiki's Classic Server Protocol page
* When setting the player ratio to show, non-numbers and a ratio with 0 max 
  players will display as "???" on the client. Player ratio also cuts into the 
  max length of the message of the day.
