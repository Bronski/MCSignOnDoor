MINECRAFT Sign On Door
Version %VERSION%
by Tustin2121
----------------------
This program tells players attempting to connect to a minecraft server on this 
machine a message (defaulting to a 'server is off' message). This program 
cannot and is not meant to run while the minecraft server itself is running; 
it is meant to give a message to players as to why the server is not running.

Usage: java -jar MCSignOnDoor.jar [switches]
Command line switches:
	-? --help
		    Displays this message and quits
	-p --port
		    Sets the port the messenger runs on (default: %PORT%)
	-i --address
		    Sets the ip address the messenger runs on (default: null)
	-m --message
		    Sets the message to send to connecting players (250 char max)

		    differentiate between normal and blacklisted players.[1]
	   --ipmessage

		    differentiate between normal and ip-banned players.[1][2]
	   --motd
	   	    Sets the server list message of the day. Default: the message
	   	    setting, truncated. (â‰¤60 char max)
	   --ignoreping	
		    Sets McSod to ignore incoming pings; Server appears offline
	   --players

	-l --log
		    Supplies a log file to write to (default: does not use log file)
	-s --silent
		    Does not print output to the screen

Notes:
[1] When using special case messages (white and banned list messages), McSod 
    will attempt to load the appropriate files that the Minecraft server uses 
    to store these lists.

[2] If a blacklist message is set, it is also applied to ip-banned players, 
    unless the ip-banned players message is separately set.

[3] When setting the player ratio to show, non-numbers and a ratio with 0 max 
    players will display as "???" on the client. Player ratio also cuts into 
    the max length of the motd setting.

[*] Some command lines treat the bang (!) as a special command character.
    If you would like to use a bang in your server message, be sure to escape
    it with a backslash (\).
  
[*] Messages can also contain color codes by using an ampersand (&) followed 
    by a hexadecimal value (0-9 a-f). See the MC wiki's Classic Server 
    Protocol page.
